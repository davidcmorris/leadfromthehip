In Shane's new book, [The Great Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=shane+parrish+mental+models&qid=1555174204&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmr0),
he talks about building a circle of confidence.  In it, he emphasises sticking with your strengths and
relying on what you know best when faced with new challenges.  However, he goes on to say this is hard to do
because ego gets in the way.  Below is an excerpt recommending people keep a record of their wins and losses (or
good and bad decisions).
> We have a problem of honest self reporting. We don't keep the right records because we don't really want to know
what we're good and bad at.  Ego is a powerful enemy when it comes to understanding reality...  

>If you are in a leadership position, you need to observe and chronicle the results of your decisions and evalute them based on
what you were trying to achieve.  You need to be honest about your failures in order to reflect and learn from them.
That's what it takes.
