During TWIT 293: Undressed for your comfort, a podcast hosted by Leo Laporte,
Kevin Rose was asked about 'lessons learned' during his six years at his first major start-up digg.com.
Specifically, what had he learned that will help him in his latest venture:

> In the early days of Digg, we started bringing on employees.
We were growing so fast from a traffic standpoint that our solution was to throw more warm bodies at the problem.
We needed more coders so we hired them as fast as possible.
Then one day, I woke up and looked around. There were 20, 30, or 40 people that I didn't know.
I didn't hire them. We brought in some B and C grade talent and they in turn brought in their C and D grade friends.
All of a sudden, you have a big challenge when it comes to getting rid of these people and bringing in new talent.
Going forward, I'm making sure that I am involved in every aspect of hiring.
You live and die by the quality of talent that you're bringing in.
So I'm handpicking every single person coming onto my new project.

As I listened to him, I was reminded of Dunbar's Number which proposes a theoretical
limit on the number of personal social relationships one person can keep track of in his/her head at any time.
This number varies, but usually centers around 150 and shows up in many different natural settings including
the size of medieval villages, military units, and even the average number of Facebook friends one has.

The smallest successive circle is comprised of 5 to 7 people and reserved for direct family and close personal friends.
The kind of people you'd call if you needed to borrow money are got into some real trouble.
My recommendation for Kevin Rose is as his new venture builds, he and his 3 to 5 closest and most
trusted business advisors do all the hiring.
That way, it frees him up to focus on executing his business plan,
but ensures that the talent being brought into the company doesn't degrade as they grow bigger.
