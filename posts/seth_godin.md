From The Art of Charm podcast Episode 336:  Seth Godin, Conquering the Dip at ~36 minute mark:
> Serving people doesn't mean giving them a discount.
Serving people means treating them with respect.
Serving people means telling them a story they need to hear.
It means building a brand that is true, that doesn't disappoint people.
It means being missed when you're gone.
