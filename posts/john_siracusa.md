Curing the Mac Power Users podcast, episode #415, hosted by David Sparks and Katie Floyd,
guest John Siracusa shared his insight on what it takes to advance from an individual contributor into management.
What follows is not a direct quote from John.
Instead, I've taken some liberty in summarizing his main points:
> We all start out in the trenches learning our individual jobs
Over time, we begin to formulate our own opinions about how and what work should get done at the company.
We are motivated to move up the career ladder in order to have more influence.
To do that, we broaden our knowledge base and work experiences and begin to share our opinions with people
outside our immediate team/department.

John also shares some good advice on how to get the most out of meetings,
but I recommend you listen to the podast to learn how.
