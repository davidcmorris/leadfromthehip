 Michael Merzenich during an interview with Ginger Campbell on her Brain Science podcast:  
 > We all have the potential to be in a better place because the brain is plastic to be stronger, 
 better, more successful. No matter how much you've struggled or where you've been, you are in charge 
 of your life going forward. You have the capacity and resources to make changes for the better.
