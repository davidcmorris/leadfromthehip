In his 1975 paper titled, [The Organization and the Person:
Final Report if the Individual-Organizational Linkage Project](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED111959.pdf),
[Lyman Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_W._Porter) lists seven areas to focus on during the crucial
early stages of the employee lifecycle: 

1. Focus on new hires expectations coming into the door pre-entry expectations of new members,  
2. Monitor early, organizational experiences,  
3. Determine where commitment to the organization is most crucial and concentrate attention there,  
4. Develop suborganization attachment,  
5. Create jobs with greater scope,  
6. Discover job dimensionality,  
7. Individualize incentives.
