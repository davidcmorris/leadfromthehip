*Minute Mark - 15:37*
> We understand that we are going to sometimes make decisions that aren't going to work and the people we work with are going to sometimes make decisions that aren't going to work all the time either.  We have a mentality that recognizes this and doesn't criticize people every time something goes wrong and we try to hire people who aren't terribly emotional or egotistical, who don't have a lot of hubris or testosterone, and I think we try to have a mellow organization which is very helpful in all these regards.

*How do you test for that?*

> Just talking.  We don't run psychological tests.  The first step in solving a personnel or management problem is acknowledging it.  So if you put a high priority on hiring the person I just described, you have a better chance of doing so and we do.
