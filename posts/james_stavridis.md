In [The Art of Manliness Podcast #373](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/leaders-reading-list/),
Brett McKay interviews Admiral James Stavridis about his new book,
[The Leader’s Bookshelf](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Bookshelf-James-Stavridis/dp/1682471799/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517272350&sr=8-1&keywords=the+leader%27s+bookshelf).  

Terrific interview filled with many stories of great military leaders and the books they’ve read.
At the 31:40 mark in the podcast, Admiral James lists four leadership behaviors that frequently came up while doing
research for his book:  

1. Good leaders are good communicators,
2. Good leaders build teams and aren’t afraid of surrounding themselve’s with talented people who don’t always agree with them,
3. Leaders are innovators and like to try new things,
4. Finally, there is an general emphasis on integrity and good character.  

I’m looking forward to his next book which is on leadership and character.
