Alex asked PJ Voigt and Alex Goldman what finally pushed them, what was it that tipped the scales in getting them 
to leave their current jobs to work at Alex's new start-up Gimlet Media with their brand new podcast, Reply All:
> The idea of working with you (Alex) as an editor was really appealing,
and the idea of having some ownership over the work was very appealing.
Both of these things were not on the current offer (at current place).
