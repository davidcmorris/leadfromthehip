I recently watched a documentary on the musician Bill Withers.
Toward the end of it, he shared his views on realizing your potential:
> We're all accidents at birth. We don't get to choose what we look like,
how gifted we're going to be, or how tall and strong we are.
One day somebody says, "You are."
At that point if we're sane enough, we have a choice to decide how much we're going to apply ourselves."
