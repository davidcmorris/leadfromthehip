EconTalk's Russ Roberts interviews former CEO of Cargill and asks him,  
*Any particular lessons you learned from going into that chair of CEO?*

> ...a sense of nakedness.  I think each word and each gesture is over analyzed by a large
group of people internally and externally.  I think you come from a small town and hopefully
are sincerely modest and you find yourself and your comments being overly impactful to people.
I think you learn very quickly that the risks of thinking out loud are greater than the benefits of it.
So my goal had never been to be anything but transparent, but there is a certain caution that you grow
into rather quickly as you find out that people have a hard time distinguishing between what is part of
your learning process and your verbalizing in order to get peoples reaction versus what actually encourages people
to act on those thoughts.
