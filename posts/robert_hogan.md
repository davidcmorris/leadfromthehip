Of the many books and articles I've read on change management, I've never come across anything that sticks as well as the following from [Robert Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hogan_(psychologist)) in his book, Personality and the Fate of Organizations:
> The key to the change process is a change in behavior. 
If we **behave** differently, we will begin to **perceive** ourselves differently, 
and it time, others will too (reputation - I added the emphasis and reputation).
