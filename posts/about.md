# What to expect when reading this blog?

- I like listening to podcasts during my commute.  One of my favorite things to discover while listening to them is when the discussion cuts to aspects or topics related to leadership.  
- Typically, these discussions come up naturally and unplanned.  
- Hence, the title for this blog, Lead from the Hip.
